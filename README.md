# CDSLib - Agents

Welcome to the Agent Based Model of the Contagious Disease Simulation Library

![repo_logo](./images/CDSLib_agents_white-background.png "CDSLib - Agents Logo")

## Description

The model consists of a population of agents following rules of behaviour determining their movement and their infectious and clinical state evolution.

Agents are able to move in a bidemensional space following a distribution of velocities based on population data. Every agent is in one out of many infective and clinical states set by the user, they may be as simple as susceptible, infected and recovered or, more states may be added according to user specification i.e. hospitalized, severe, latent, etc. 

## Features
